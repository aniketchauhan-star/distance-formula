   Swifty's voice.

   One recording of the whole script — every line the game says, read
   in the order it says them, with the maths said in words ("three,
   comma, two"; "x two minus x one") — cut into one file per line in
   sfx/voices. Each line was found in it by its words and cut in the
   silence either side. Each file is numbered in that order and named
   for the line it says. (The recording itself is in the repository's
   history: sfx/new voice.mp3, up to commit bcf997d.)

   The lines written since came in a second recording, read in the order
   the game says them and cut the same way, numbered on from 69 (in the
   history too: sfx/aniket new.mp3). It was set on its own level to match
   the first, so the two sound like one voice.

   The seven written after that came in a third, read in the same order
   and cut, slowed and levelled the same way, numbered on from 92 (in the
   history as well, under the first one's name: sfx/new voice.mp3, in the
   commit that brought clips 92 to 98).

   She speaks a little slower than she was recorded, for young
   listeners: the whole recording was slowed to nine-tenths of its speed
   (115/128 exactly, the nearest step Apple's time-pitch unit takes — the
   one Safari slows speech with) at the same pitch, before it was cut,
   and every clip encoded afresh. Each opens 50 ms before her first
   sound, and where she took a breath between two lines the breath is in
   neither.

   A line the game no longer says goes, and its clip with it — the
   clip is in the history, as the recordings are ("That’s right!" and
   "Exactly!" went when every right answer became "That’s correct!").

   MAP is the only thing to edit: the line on the left, then its file
   and how long that file runs. The length is written down rather than
   read off the clip because a browser reports no duration until the
   file's metadata has arrived — and the words are paced to it, so a
   line asked for early would otherwise be paced to nothing.

   A line with no entry simply plays no voice: the game falls back to
   the little per-word notes it used before, so a gap here is quiet
   rather than broken.
