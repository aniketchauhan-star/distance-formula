  /* ---------------- responsive stage ---------------- */
  /* The whole responsive system, in one function.

     The game is authored at one size and scaled as a single object, so
     every screen gets the same layout rather than a layout of its own:
     nothing reflows, nothing is repositioned per device, and the only
     thing that changes between a 1366 laptop and a 2560 desktop is the
     number below. `min` of the two ratios is what keeps it honest —
     one scale for both axes, so the aspect is preserved and a screen
     that is not 16:9 gets bars rather than a stretched picture.

     It measures #viewport, not the window. Those are usually the same
     number and sometimes not, and every time they differ the window is
     the wrong one:

       - `innerWidth` includes the classic scrollbar gutter, so a
         stylesheet that failed to load, or any future overflow, makes
         the stage ~15px wider than the room it has and clips it;
       - on a tablet or phone with a collapsing URL bar, the window can
         still be reporting the old height at the moment `resize` fires,
         while the fixed box has already been re-laid-out;
       - and a container can change size with no window event at all —
         fullscreen, devtools docking, split view or Stage Manager on an
         iPad, or the page running inside an iframe that resizes.

     #viewport is `position: fixed; inset: 0`, so its box IS the room
     available, whatever caused it to change. Measuring the thing we
     have to fit into, and watching that same thing, answers all four. */

  /* The design space, published to CSS once, so a stylesheet that needs
     to know how much room the whole frame has can ask for it instead of
     reaching for `vw`. The config is where the size is decided; the
     stylesheet's own :root values are the fallback that keeps the first

       its border dead-ended in mid-air and the tail's flat top jutted
       out past the curve as a step. Overlapping them harder only moved
       the step. Drawn as one outline the join cannot exist — the box's
       underside simply carries on down to the point and back up.

         `zeroGap` asks, unless that would crowd −1, in which case as
