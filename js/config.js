     SPRITE SHEETS
     Both sheets are 1448 x 1086 holding 8 poses in a 4 x 2 grid.
     The nominal 362 x 543 cells are NOT usable directly: several
     flying poses bleed past their cell edge, and the two rows sit
     at different heights, so naive cell slicing clips wings and
     makes the bird jump vertically at the row change.

     `rect`   = exact opaque bounds of each pose, measured from the
                alpha channel.
     `anchor` = centroid of the yellow belly, in sheet coordinates.
                The belly is rigidly attached to the body and barely
                moves while the wings flap, so pinning it to a fixed
                point keeps every pose registered to the same spot.
